# Task-Manager
[UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

* Developed a full-stack task management application using React.js for the frontend and .NET 8 Web API for the backend, applying clean architecture, modular code structure, and async/await for efficient task processing.
* Built responsive and interactive UI in React.js using functional components, Hooks, and controlled forms to create, validate, and display tasks dynamically in a tabular layout with computed status labels.
* Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints (POST /api/tasks, GET /api/tasks) with proper input validation, HTTP status codes, and service-layer logic using tuples and C# extension methods for task status computation.
* Utilised an in-memory data store for backend task persistence, allowing fast, database-free prototyping while maintaining clean separation of concerns via dependency injection and testable service layers.
* Deployed the application on Azure App Services, ensuring accessibility and scalability of both frontend and backend components, and tested full-stack integration in a live cloud environment
